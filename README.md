# IT-Academy final project using C# 
This console game is representing a classic Tetris game where you have a “cup” and falling down blocks in different shapes, you should move and rotate the blocks by pressing control buttons on the keyboard until they form a solid line or until the blocks reach the edge of the game cup.
After some time the speed of falling blocks will increase. 
Also, I added the ability to see all scores and send them to the player’s e-mail.

## Functionality:

#### Start window:
* name of application(e.g. “IT-Academy project”);
